# Airline-Reservation-System
The project is Airline Reservation System:
Our main aim is to write a program to assign seats on each flight of the airlines only place (capacity: 15 seats).
The program should never assign a seat that is already assigned. If there’s no seat available, then print the message " the flight is full ".
After the flight is full and someone wants to cancel the booking, it is displaying enter you’re the passport number you want to cancel it so after the passenger cancels it, the system directly free that place if someone wants to book that seat.
Moreover, the system should bring a boarding pass indicating the persons' name, passport number, and seat number as each seat is assigned, set the corresponding elements of the array to 1 to indicate that the seat is no longer available.
